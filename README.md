## Objective
The reason to use Scrapy and Selenium in combination is that Selenium extracts the links, and Scrapy follows all the links to scrape the data. Using Selenium alone takes more time, but the combination is much faster.

## Link Discovery:
- Selenium efficiently identifies and retrieves links from the webpage, allowing for more accurate and dynamic link discovery compared to traditional Scrapy spider logic.

## Performance Improvement:
- Scrapy, known for its speed and efficiency in handling structured data, is then utilized to follow the links and scrape the desired information. This combination often results in better performance compared to using Selenium alone, which can be slower due to its browser automation overhead.

## Parallel Processing:
- Scrapy's asynchronous and parallel processing capabilities can be fully leveraged when following multiple links concurrently, further enhancing the overall scraping speed.

## Considerations:
- It's essential to be mindful of the website's terms of service and legal considerations when performing web scraping activities.
- Regularly check and adapt the code as websites may undergo changes that impact the structure or behavior of the pages.

## Other Scrapy Settings:
I did not change the other Scrapy settings.

## Conclusion:
By combining the strengths of both Scrapy and Selenium, you achieve a powerful and efficient web scraping solution that can handle a wide range of scenarios, especially those involving dynamic content and link-heavy structures. The synergy between these tools provides a balance between speed and flexibility, ensuring successful data extraction from complex websites.
